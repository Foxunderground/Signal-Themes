# Zero Two Theme

This theme is based on the character Zero Two from the anime: Darling in the Franxx

This was my first attempt at creating a theme for Signal, and so I didn't put too much effort into this theme. This was tested with signal v5.9.0

## instructions:

1. Download [7zip](https://www.7-zip.org/)
2. Install the [7zip asar extension](https://www.tc4shell.com/en/7zip/asar/). Follow the steps on the download page to correctly install it
3. Exit Signal if it's already running
4. Open your `app.asar` file at C:\Users\user_name\AppData\Local\Programs\signal-desktop\resources\app.asar with 7-Zip. Open it by right clicking it and then going to 7zip and then Open Archive
5. Find `/stylesheets/manifest.css` in it. Right click on the file and select Edit.
6. Copy the entire content of this theme and paste **AFTER** the contents of `manifest.css`.
7. Save & close your editor and then 7-Zip will ask you if you want to apply modifications to the original `app.asar` file. Confirm it and then close 7-Zip.
8. Finally open signal to test if it works.
9. In the signal desktop app go to File > Preferences and select dark theme
10. Finally click on the your profile icon in the top left corner of the screen besides the search bar, and then select chat color and select the red color (2nd color)

That is all. Feel free to open any issues or let me know if you have any improvements.
