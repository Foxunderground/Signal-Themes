# Signal-Themes

A collection of themes for Signal

Further installation instructions may vary from theme to theme, thus a detailed guide is provided in the readme file of each theme.

This was inspired by the work of [CapnSparrow](https://github.com/CapnSparrow/signal-desktop-themes)
Credits to them for finding an appropriate way to allow the modifications required to change the layout of the Signal app.
